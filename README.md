# DECIMAL to BINARY and BINARY TO DECIMAL converter

This project is within the academic framework, it is requested to design an interface on matlab which allows to choose at first
real to binary conversion (With options: Floating and fixed point with both precisions) and binary to real conversion
and the latter can take the binary number encoded in 16 and 24 bit fixed point and 32 and 64 bit floating point.

## To start
Open the index file to beginning with the interface.
Initially the interface openns on the first option "Conversion Real-->Binary", the user puts a number in the first
"Reel" field and select the other Comma and Precision choices to note that all conversions are signed, then press Enter for the conversion.
For option 2 "Conversion Binary-->Real" which has a single input field and a validity button, the user can put the number in binary of any type, of course respecting the predefined bit number for a machine :
     16 or 17 with '.' for the comma;
     24 or 25 with '.' for the comma;
     32 bits for floating point (Pay attention to spaces);
     64 bits for floating point.

If there is an overflow or the number of bits is not respected, the interface displays a message indicating the error.


### Prerequisites
This project was done on the 2021a version of matlab.

The user must have this version or an earlier version to be able to use it.


## Startup

Once the file has been downloaded and decompressed, open your matlab software, press "open script" and select the index file which represents the main file of the project.
